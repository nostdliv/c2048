# C 2048
Pure c console implementation of famous 2048 game,
tagetting to be adaptive to various terminal sizes.

# Dev status
For now game has no actual logic, but rendering works kinda fine.  
I think, for now logic has a higher priority,
then auto terminal size detection, user interface and arguments parsing.  

With that in mind, checklist:

1. Rendering tiles: **implemented.**
2. Game logic
3. User interface
4. Command line arguments parsing
